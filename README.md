# Graphs
A graph is an Abstract Data Type that models relationships using nodes and edges. 

In Python, a graph is data structure that consists of a set of nodes or vertices, and a set of edges that connect them. Graphs are often used to represent relationships between objects, such as in social networks, transportation systems, or computer networks.

There are several ways to represent a graph in Python, including using adjacency lists, adjacency matrices, or edge lists. In an adjacency list representation, each node is associated with a list of its neighboring nodes. In adjacency matrix representation, the graph is represented as a matrix, where each cell (i,j) represents the edge between nodes i and j. In an edge list representation, the graph is represented as a list of edges, where each edge is a tuple of two nodes.

Python provides several libraries for working with graphs, including NetworkX, igraph, and Graph-tool. These libraries provide functions for creating, manipulating, and visualizing graphs, as well as algorithms for analyzing properties of graphs, such as shortest paths, clustering, and centrality.
